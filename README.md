# Bouncing-balls-game-
A project I undertook as part of an MDN web developer course. This project is modelled on Object-oriented programming. It shows the use of objects in JavaScript.
The balls are drawn with Canvas API and animated with requestAnimationFrame API. The balls will bounce around on the screen, and change color when they touch each other.
The user-controlled evil circle which will eat the balls if it catches them makes this demo a litte interactive and fun.
